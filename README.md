This project contains several coding challenges which may be used in coding
interviews to evaluate how good a developer is in terms of:

* algorithms
* language's standard library
* code organization
* object orientation
* error handling

Those challenges are arranged in difficult levels in order to be applied to
people according to their skill level. This repository a bunch of problems
(which is a Javadoc on one of the classes), some tests which maps the
desired behaviour of the program and one implementation that solves it. The
problems might be ported to other languages, but both tests and a valid
solution need to be coded in order to evaluate who attempts to solve it.

There are many ways in which these problems might be used:

* offer a problem and tests, request for an implementation
* offer a problem and an implementation, request for tests
* offer a problem, request both an implementation and tests

This is a work in progress, so a few adjusts and optimizations might be
necessary. All feedback and new problem proposals are welcome.
